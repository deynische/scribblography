                <p>So far, I have written six posts at a weekly rate. Seven if you include this one. I want to check in and do some reflection about how my writing is coming along.</p>
<p>For anyone who strives to be a content creator, it’s generally understood that <strong>content is king</strong>. The masses will always sift for and uphold content they like. Of course there are plenty of tips and tricks to seduce the digital algorithms into suggesting your content more often, but it will always boil down to how helpful, informative, or entertaining your content is.</p>
<p>Running a blog means writing content. Here’s what I’ve learned from the last two months:</p>
<h2 id="For-More-Depth-Do-Some-Research"><a href="#For-More-Depth-Do-Some-Research" class="headerlink" title="For More Depth, Do Some Research"></a>For More Depth, Do Some Research</h2><p>My writing goal has always been to be informative. I consume a lot of material you could class as educational and I like to share what I’ve learned. Naturally, writing requires me to pull up a list of resources, thoroughly study my subject matter, and parse it into my own words. Early on, I discovered this process takes me a minimum of a week to churn out an article.</p>
<p>I’m the sort that writes while researching. I start with a general gist of where I want my writing to go. For the first couple of days, I’ll start doing some basic research to verify I have the correct idea in mind. Then I transcribe my stream of conscious until I have questions. </p>
<p><strong>Writing is boring if it ends with “I don’t know”.</strong> You wouldn’t have a reason to read it; there’s nothing to learn. So it’s worth spending more time finding answers. Those answers lead me to a new point. Then I ask more questions. And on and on until I find a natural conclusion.</p>
<p>In this sense, the research itself lends a natural storytelling quality to writing. In asking questions and finding answers, we show our engagement with the subject at hand. And that provides the depth to be interesting.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-Edit-Edit-Edit-Some-More"><a href="#Edit-Edit-Edit-Edit-Some-More" class="headerlink" title="Edit, Edit, Edit. Edit Some More."></a>Edit, Edit, Edit. Edit Some More.</h2><p>It’s tempting to believe the writing is done once all the information has been put on the page. But doing this won’t improve my writing skills. Because at it’s core, writing is communication.</p>
<p>Therefore, I need to go back and spend a day to rewrite, reword, and tweak those sentences ever so carefully. <strong>Information isn’t interesting if it cannot be understood.</strong> I’m often very wordy, with run-on sentences running amok everywhere. I’m excessive with filler words. I’ll jumble my adjectives and adverbs while misusing words. Often, I’m very tempted to leave a tangential distracting thought.</p>
<p>All of these things are bad habits obfuscating what I’m trying to share. Only through editing can I improve my ability to get my ideas to be palatable and digestible. Otherwise, it’s just garbage.</p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Skip-Practice-Don’t-Take-Shortcuts"><a href="#Don’t-Skip-Practice-Don’t-Take-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Skip Practice, Don’t Take Shortcuts"></a>Don’t Skip Practice, Don’t Take Shortcuts</h2><p>The second part of being a content creator is regularity. The content you make must eventually be delivered and it’s best if it’s done on a predictable schedule.</p>
<p>This is something I struggle with.</p>
<p>When I started Scribblography, I decided to be easy on myself and set a goal to have something to post every week. I had an ample amount of time to devote to research, writing, and editing my weekly content. I even planned to overshoot and keep a stock of drafts for rainy days.</p>
<p>Then I got a full-time day job a few weeks after launch.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep posting once a week, I started to bullshit the research and cut the editing. Essentially, I was taking shortcuts just to say I wrote a thing and published it live. The consequence is the quality of my writing efforts have severely suffered.</p>
<p>I used to be guilt-ridden about my apparent lack of discipline. That is, until I realized the stark difference of my efforts before after getting a day job. If I had the same amount of time before employment, I wouldn’t slack on my weekly writing. If I kept up with my efforts after employment, I wouldn’t be able to commit to the weekly schedule.</p>
<p>This is a classic case of the unattainable triangle: you can be quick, you can do well, or you can be frugal. Pick two out of three options.</p>
<p>So, in keeping with my original goal of improving the quality of my writing, I’m going to have to drop the weekly schedule. I don’t intend to quit Scribblography, but posting may be sporadic until I figure out a better writing schedule.</p>
<p>Here’s to a quality writing habit.</p>
