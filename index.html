                <p>I have always felt weird about my name. I recognize it’s my name and I absolutely respond to it, but I feel alienated and disconnected when I see it written out in all it’s glory. I’m not really sure what that means.</p>
<p>Hence, I usually operate under an alias. One typically makes aliases to eventually throw away and start anew, but mine has stuck for quite some time. As a result, my identity has comfortably settled in like the first apartment you truly call home.</p>
<p>This has made presenting online an interesting experience.</p>
<p>Despite my aversion to my name, I find there’s this peer pressure to attach it to my digital presence. Especially when trying to find work through the internet. Consider LinkedIn. It’s literally considered a faux pas to not <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/28422/names-allowed-on-profiles?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use your real name</a>.</p>
<h2 id="The-Trouble-With-Real-Names"><a href="#The-Trouble-With-Real-Names" class="headerlink" title="The Trouble With Real Names"></a>The Trouble With Real Names</h2><p>Your given name actually reveals quite a bit about yourself. Every culture has a roster of popular names and chances are yours ranks somewhere on that list. In addition to that, we all have an intuitive sense for what names are designated feminine versus masculine. We have learned to understand that Jane Kozlowski is a white woman whereas Trevon Williams is a black man.</p>
<p>That’s all fine and good. Until you remember that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-your-name-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bias exists</a>. Non-white folks are painfully aware of the <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of a white name</a>. Not to mention the constant tension over <a href="https://theconversation.com/men-and-women-biased-about-studies-of-stem-gender-bias-in-opposite-directions-48924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which gender is favored</a> professionally.</p>
<p>And then there’s the problem with commonality. How does one James Smith distinguish themselves from the thousands of others of the same name? Maybe one talks music while another prides in slow cooking. That works in a local sense.</p>
<p>But not so much online. Online presence can <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2015-05-13-35-percent-of-employers-less-likely-to-interview-applicants-they-cant-find-online-according-to-annual-CareerBuilder-social-media-recruitment-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make</a> or <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2018-08-09-More-Than-Half-of-Employers-Have-Found-Content-on-Social-Media-That-Caused-Them-NOT-to-Hire-a-Candidate-According-to-Recent-CareerBuilder-Survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break</a> your chances with professional success. And with a common name, you’re probably not going to be able to set up your professional email to the much <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/professional-email-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advised format</a> without having to trail a few numbers at the end.</p>
<h2 id="Your-Personal-Brand-Is-An-Alias"><a href="#Your-Personal-Brand-Is-An-Alias" class="headerlink" title="Your Personal Brand Is An Alias"></a>Your Personal Brand Is An Alias</h2><p>This online presence is actually your personal brand which can be easily managed and controlled. There’s actually a whole industry dedicated to it: reputation management.</p>
<p>While you can build your brand on your name, it might just be easier to go with an alias. Because, let’s be honest, your personal brand is an alias of you. Work you is different from romantic you which is different from family you. It’s easy to slip from one alias to the other when you move between contexts.</p>
<p>However, these little invisible boundaries don’t exist online. Some might be fine with having all facets of themselves tied together. Others would rather keep their social circles separated. Having distinct aliases can help keep your level of enmeshment manageable.</p>
<p>Here’s how to compose an alias:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remix your name into a nickname</li>
<li>Draw inspiration from your hobbies</li>
<li>Explore other languages</li>
<li>Try abbreviations or alternate spellings</li>
</ul>
<p>So the music buff James Smith from earlier might be known as <code>ampersmith</code> whereas the slow cooking James Smith might be known as <code>jroastchuckle</code>. With aliases, they are both easily distinguishable and free to build on those names as they please.</p>
<h2 id="Names-Are-Never-Permanent"><a href="#Names-Are-Never-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="Names Are Never Permanent"></a>Names Are Never Permanent</h2><p>Here’s one more trouble with real names: what if you have yours legally changed?</p>
<p>I already mentioned how aliases are generally used temporarily, but our given names are hardly ever set in stone. People legally change their names all the time due to all kinds of life events.</p>
<p>In the case of marriage, choosing what to do with your name is a deeply personal one. It’s also something that can drastically affect the brand you’ve built for yourself. You may end up having to tediously build all those associations between your new and old names. But in the same way multiple aliases can be tied to one person, you don’t have to lose your branding if you have one alias but multiple known legal names.</p>
<p>Whatever name you decide to invest in is the name that holds the majority of your online identity. Real or alias.</p>
