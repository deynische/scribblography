                <p>There’s something irritating about turning to Google for help and finding articles written half a decade ago. Depending on what you’re looking for, either the advice is still sound or it’s incredibly outdated.</p>
<p>This made Scribblography’s launch unnecessarily complicated last week. I’m using GitHub Pages to host this blog but old advice made the custom domain set-up confusing. Now that everything is done, it’s clear to me the process is as streamlined as ever.</p>
<p>The usual GitHub Pages domain is something along the lines of:<br><code>your-username.github.io/project-repo-name</code></p>
<p>If you have your own domain, you can use it instead of the default domain. This involves two parts: <code>CNAME</code> records and <code>A</code> records.</p>
<h2 id="Giving-Your-Domain-A-Direction"><a href="#Giving-Your-Domain-A-Direction" class="headerlink" title="Giving Your Domain A Direction"></a>Giving Your Domain A Direction</h2><p>Think of a domain as the name of a place. For example: The Central Library. Just telling you about The Central Library doesn’t let you know where it is.</p>
<p>You can think of <code>A</code> records as the address to a place. I could say The Central Library is located on Fourth &amp; Madison. Or I could say The Central Library is located at 1000 4th Ave. Either way, it points you to where you should go.</p>
<p>In terms of domains, <code>A</code> records are usually in the form of IP addresses. The <code>A</code> records need to be setup where ever your domain name is managed. This may or may not be the same place where your domain name is registered.</p>
<p>To use a custom domain with your GitHub Pages site, you need to set up <code>A</code> records pointing to GitHub’s IP addresses. As of this post, these are the four addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>185.199.108.153</li>
<li>185.199.109.153</li>
<li>185.199.110.153</li>
<li>185.199.111.153</li>
</ul>
<p>Truthfully, you could probably get away with just one <code>A</code> record. But it doesn’t hurt to have all four.</p>
<h2 id="Associating-Your-Domain-With-Your-Project"><a href="#Associating-Your-Domain-With-Your-Project" class="headerlink" title="Associating Your Domain With Your Project"></a>Associating Your Domain With Your Project</h2><p>Now that you have your domain pointing to GitHub, you need to set up the name association.</p>
<p>For instance, I told you The Central Library is located at 1000 4th Ave. But when you show up to that location, how do you know you’re at The Central Library? I don’t know about you, but I start looking for a sign on a door or a window.</p>
<p>You can think of <code>CNAME</code> records as way to identify your domain.</p>
<p>If you set up your custom domain in your GitHub project’s settings, it should automatically create a <code>CNAME</code> file for you within your repo branch.</p>
<p>If you have a set-up where you’re deploying your website updates to your repo branch, remember to include your <code>CNAME</code> file in your source folder. Otherwise, it might go missing and your project will lose the association to the domain name. Like a building missing it’s signage.</p>
<p>At this point, you should be all set up and ready to go!</p>
<h2 id="Getting-It-All-To-Go-To-The-Same-Place"><a href="#Getting-It-All-To-Go-To-The-Same-Place" class="headerlink" title="Getting It All To Go To The Same Place"></a>Getting It All To Go To The Same Place</h2><p>Across the web, you might have noticed how same places use the <code>www</code> prefix and others don’t. You might have also noticed how some places will automatically fill in the <code>www</code> whereas others remove it.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<p>The technical jargon is that <code>www.example.com</code> is an alias of <code>example.com</code> or vice versa.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like the how The Central Library around here is also known as The Seattle Public Library. If I say either name, you’ll know it’s the geometric building on Fourth &amp; Madison. However, if you look it up, it’s technically The Seattle Public Library. It just happens to also be known as The Central Library.</p>
<p>Two different names. Same place.</p>
<p>For domains, you need to know this isn’t an automatic association. Whatever domain name you went with in your repo’s <code>CNAME</code> file is the proper name for your site. The other one probably doesn’t point to anything.</p>
<p>If you thought setting up another <code>CNAME</code> record is the solution, you’re right! However, you can’t have more than domain name in a <code>CNAME</code> record and you can’t have more than one <code>CNAME</code> file in the same place. That’s just too confusing.</p>
<p>To set up an alias, you need to go to where you set up your <code>A</code> records. From there, you set up a <code>CNAME</code> record to associate your alias domain to your GitHub account. It’ll look something like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Record</th>
<th>Domain</th>
<th>Data</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>CNAME</code></td>
<td><code>www.example.com</code></td>
<td><code>your-username.github.io</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From here, GitHub Pages will automatically resolve your site domain to the version you want people to go to.</p>
<h2 id="What-About-HTTPS"><a href="#What-About-HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="What About HTTPS?"></a>What About HTTPS?</h2><p>I’m sure you’ve noticed that for a better secure web experience, HTTPS is now the standard. The S stands for “secure” and this is achieved through a secure sockets layer, known as SSL or an SSL certificate. In order to earn your S in HTTPS, you need to get your hands on one of these.</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2018</a>, you don’t need to do anything about this for your custom domain GitHub Pages site. GitHub has partnered with Let’s Encypt to help keep your Pages sites secure.</p>
<p>Really, you don’t need to do anything else.</p>
<h2 id="What-If-I-Really-Need-SSL"><a href="#What-If-I-Really-Need-SSL" class="headerlink" title="What If I Really Need SSL?"></a>What If I Really Need SSL?</h2><p>For a long time, GitHub didn’t offer SSL to custom domains. There are still a plethora of articles instructing how to get SSL to work with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>One popular method is to sign up with Cloudflare. They allow one free SSL certificate good for one site with your account. All you have to do to move your domain management to Cloudflare.</p>
<h2 id="A-Note-On-DNS-Propagation"><a href="#A-Note-On-DNS-Propagation" class="headerlink" title="A Note On DNS Propagation"></a>A Note On DNS Propagation</h2><p>For any updates and changes to your domain records, it may be a while for them to take effect. Most places will tell you to wait a day or two. But if you’re worried, there’s a way to check how things are progressing without refreshing your browser a million times. You just need to get to your command line.</p>
<p>For Unix and iOS users, you’ll be using the <code>dig</code> command. It stands for domain information groper. For anyone working with networking, this is probably the preferred method.</p>
<p>For Windows users, you’ll be using the <code>nslookup</code> command. It stands for nameserver lookup.</p>
<p>Either way, you can use these commands to check your domain name and see where it points to if it’s pointing to anywhere. It’ll help your impatience feel productive while you wait. It did for me when I was navigating through all of this last week.</p>
