# Hello, Internet!



My name is Lynn Vu. You might also see me under the _deynische_ handle. I'm a Sonoran living in the Pacific Northwest. I live for rainy days and I've made it a personal project to learn about all these lush green things around me. I adore cats, enjoy drawing, and occasionally tinker with tech.

I also write this blog. It's about my encounters with writing, design, and technology.

## An Ode to the Scribble



Maybe it's just me, but I find all if not most of my projects have always started with scribbles. Sometimes it's a flurry of words describing the emotive themes for a visual piece. Other times it's just some thumbnails scrawled out for a rough likeness of a landing page. Whatever it is, it always begins with the humble scribble.

So, rather than naming this blog after myself or forcing myself to narrowly focus on any one topic, I decided to give tribute to the millions of scribbles I have put to paper.

As an acknowledgment to all the ink and graphite that has helped to bring me here today, I bring to you:
