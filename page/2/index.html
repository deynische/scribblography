                <p>As a kid, I hated language arts. Some of you know this subject as English but in my childhood, they called it language arts. I’m pretty sure it was full of the same stuff: read some books, have group discussions, and write some essays.</p>
<p>I liked reading. And the group discussions were okay. But what I hated about language arts had to do with all the writing. Despite getting passing marks, I always found writing to be incredibly confusing. Growing older only made that confusion irritating.</p>
<p>I always thought there were too many rules to keep track of: </p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t start with conjunctions</li>
<li>Don’t end with prepositions</li>
<li>No sentence fragments</li>
<li>Only use “I” or “you” where appropriate</li>
<li>Mind your commas (and other punctuation)</li>
<li>Avoid cliches</li>
<li>Show, don’t tell</li>
<li>At least four sentences in a paragraph</li>
<li>Indent, double space, one inch margins</li>
<li>No run on sentences (and mind your clauses)</li>
<li>Keep your tenses consistent</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>My little brain back then would busy itself over every essay I had to write for class, deftly editing out any shred of my own natural voice. Undo all my grammatically confused speech patterns. Erase nearly all pronouns. Regurgitate a thesaurus to help with “showing” instead of “telling.” Everything I wrote would result in this hyper-stiff sterilized robo speech.</p>
<p>Hey, it helped me get an A.</p>
<p>But I still didn’t really get writing. It was all a matter of rubrics and technicalities to me. When I would see great authors breaking school-taught writing rules, I felt uneasy. Sometimes I would try to mimic the books we had read, sneaking a fragment sentence in my paper to emphasize my point.  But my attempts always got marked during proofreading. The whole thing was discouraging.</p>
<p><strong>So I went out of my way to avoid writing because I was bad at it.</strong></p>
<p>Now, you can’t really get by in this world without doing a little bit of writing. But chances are that no one really considers your email inquiries in the office or your favorite insta-artists emoji-filled captions to be “real” writing.</p>
<p>Years later, a book found it’s way onto my reading list. It originally started as a mention in one book. Then in another. Then I started seeing posts and comments highly recommending it in my search for graphic design books. It’s called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1199715.Hey_Whipple_Squeeze_This" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hey Whipple, Squeeze This</em></a>.</p>
<p>It’s a guide to advertising. I’ve made ads before. Seems useful.</p>
<p>Eventually, I picked it up from my local library. I found it incredibly enjoyable in comparison to some of the other texts I had been reading. Yet I didn’t expect to be floored after reading this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write like you talk.</p>
<p>Write with a smooth, easy rhythm that sounds natural. Obey the rules of grammar and go easy on the adjectives. Short sentences are best. One-word sentences? Fine. End with a preposition if you want to. And if it feels right, begin a sentence with “and.” Just be clear.</p>
<p>Through it all, remember, you are selling something. Easy to forget when you start slinging words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many other lovely passages on writing persuasive and effective copy. However, this paragraph, being the diametric opposite of everything drilled into my memory from my school days, was the antidote to my writing block.</p>
<p>I finally understood the point of writing. It’s not about appeasing an arbritrary set of guidelines while blindly arguing a ridiculous thesis. At its core, writing is simply articulating a thought. <strong>Good writing is articulating a thought that makes another person take action.</strong> That action can be anything: buying, selling, signing up, quitting, or even thinking.</p>
<p>I thought about my relationship to writing.</p>
<p>Looking back now, I realize that I was taught a formal academic style. It’s a very valid skill, especially if I had decided to pursue academia. However, I never learned to develop my own personal style. Without it, my sense of storytelling and voice has suffered by neglect.</p>
<p>As a designer, I find this unacceptable.</p>
<p>But the only thing I can do now is make up for all the years I missed out on writing. It’s going to take some getting used to.</p>
